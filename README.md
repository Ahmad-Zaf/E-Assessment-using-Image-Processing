Overview

An automated assessment system that evaluates answer sheets using image processing techniques. This project eliminates manual checking, reduces errors, and provides faster and more reliable results.

1) Key Highlights

* Scans and processes handwritten/printed answer sheets

* Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing and answer detection

* Automatically evaluates answers against a given key

* Generates accurate scores and visual reports instantly

2) Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

3) How It Works

Upload a scanned answer sheet.

System applies preprocessing (grayscale, thresholding, contour detection).

Extracts marked answers and compares them with the correct key.

Generates a score report and highlights correct/incorrect answers.

4) Output

✔️ Automatic detection of answers
✔️ Instant score calculation
✔️ Visual feedback on mistakes
